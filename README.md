# Example-Decision-Making-JavaScript
This is a demonstration of using JavaScript to create a thought process functionality.


A computer works much like we do in the fact that it processes information in a procedure setup by other precesses. More often than not those processes involve humans intering data into the computer. Now that the age of AI is upon us we are seeing more and more applications being developed so that they can learn and grow over time. 

In this example I demonstrate the ability to use a timeout process and a suedo random number to create a process of decision making. This can be easily adapted to many situations. Each of these situations can be come a part of the over all cycle of decisions the application can make. The more decisions the more it can do effectivly. 

Question:
What ideas does this give you.

Question:
How can an application like this be utilized?

Question:

What would be a better way to write this so that its more like the human brain over a timeout effect?
